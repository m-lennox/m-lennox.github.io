(I hate to be _that AI guy_ but this is what's been on my mind these days)

Generative AI is cool. It could help you brainstorm ideas in a few seconds,
saving potentially hours of time when the application is right. But whenever
it is asked to compute numbers, it still tries to do that in words. As a result,
it often produces results much slower (and much less accurately) than any
well-trained human. Sometimes, it even attempts to
